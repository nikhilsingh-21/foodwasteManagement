# foodwasteManagement
This web app is designed to tackle food waste by enabling users to donate excess food to those in need. Users can easily post food donations, and nearby individuals or organizations can claim the food. To encourage participation, donors receive cashback rewards. Additionally, the app facilitates the installation of community refrigerators, where food can be stored and accessed by those in need. Our mission is to reduce food waste while simultaneously helping the less fortunate.
